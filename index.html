        </Header>
        <p> I've always loved being outdoors, especially in a Park or conservation area. Since around 2015, I've been enjoying alone time in the form of hiking. On these solo hikes, I've enjoyed being away from the city, breathing in fresh air, and exploring the natural world.</p>
        
        <p>For anyone reading this page, I've narrowed down my top three sites for solo hiking. Read on to find my picks along with photos and a bit of information on each site.</p>
        <h2> 1. Emmenegger Nature Park</h2>
        <p>Some of my fondest memories come from the middle of the woods in this beautiful and unique park. I've hiked the Emmenegger trail in every season throughout the years. The trail winds, goes up and down hills, and forks and winds in all directions so each visit can be a totally new experience. I highly recommend this site if you're looking for a walk with that will lead you as far as you want to go and back to the start where you can eat your packed lunch at a picnic table overlooking the river. </p>

        <h2> 2. Cliff Cave Park</h2>
        <p>Cliff Cave is my go-to place when I'm looking for a long, steady walk around a prairie, an uphill hike through the trees, or a quiet sit right on the Mississippi river. </p>

        </p>
        <h2>3. Castlewood State Park</h2>
        <p>Castlewood State Park has to be one of the most popular parks near St. Louis. Its views are unbelievable and endless. Its spacious and lush. Directly above active train tracks, at the peak of lone wolf trail, you get a sound feel for St. Louis while looking out at a magical, bending Meremac river. There's plenty to explore at this site, including a sand beach! </p>
